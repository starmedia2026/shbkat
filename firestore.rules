/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Customer Management App.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for customer data. Each customer document is secured to allow only the customer themselves to read and write their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All customer data is stored under the `/customers/{customerId}` path, where `{customerId}` is the unique identifier for the customer.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Customers can only access their own data. Listing all customers is disallowed.
 * - The `id` field within the document must match the `customerId` in the path to ensure data consistency and prevent unauthorized access. This `id` field is immutable after creation.

     * @deny (create) - Authenticated user with UID 'user_xyz' cannot create a customer document where the 'id' field is 'user_abc'.
     * @deny (get, update, delete) - Authenticated user with UID 'user_xyz' cannot get, update, or delete the customer document where the document ID is 'user_abc'.
     * @principle Enforces document ownership and validates relational integrity.
